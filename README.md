# Tixati as a Flake :)

An attempt at turning Tixati v3.26 into a flake for nix

Currently works using steam-run as a wrapper, allowing you to run Tixati from the terminal and creates a .desktop file for programs like rofi

#### **TODO**
- [ ] Make Tixati appear in the system tray
- [ ] Make it not need steam-run
- [ ] Make the flake download the tarball
